# PulltheDots
---------
Pull-the-Dots is an interactive visualization demo powered by D3.js that creatively showcases hybrid VPLS-DMVPN network behavior. The objective is simple and engaging: drag and interact with nodes (dots) to explore their connections and behavior in real time.

Features
Interactive Visualization
Drag nodes (dots) around the canvas to experience the behavior of a dynamic, hybrid network.

Hybrid VPLS-DMVPN Representation
Links between nodes include visual properties such as:

Stroke width: Represents connection strength or packet flow.
Dashed lines: Indicate DMVPN-style links.
Fully Responsive Design
The canvas adapts to fit different screen sizes, from desktops to tablets.

Artificially Generated Data
Preloaded nodes and links simulate cutting-edge technologies like AI, Big Data, IoT, and Cloud Networking.
Interactive Visualization Tool

Technical Details
Technologies Used:
D3.js: For rendering the interactive graph.
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): To ensure smooth, zoomable visuals.
Key Features in the Code:
Force Layout: A physics-based engine to simulate node movement and link interactions.
Link Styling:
Dashed lines for DMVPN links.
Color-coded connections to represent different link types.
Responsive Canvas: Automatically resizes the SVG element to fit the container.
Use Case
This demo is perfect for visualizing and promoting:

Network routing behaviors.
Hybrid architectures like VPLS and DMVPN.
